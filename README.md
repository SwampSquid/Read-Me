I hope to post some updates about the game I am currently making atm, it is a very basic Tower defense game, but I am watching an online Udemy course to teach me how to use Unity and C# programming language
just posting stuff like screenshots and short videos of what I have recently been upto

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Video games, Anime, Pokemon, and I am loving the idea of bringing my ideas to life but we have all got to start from the bascis
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# programming from an online Udemy, I sometimes use simply Piano tp teach me how to play the keyboard as well as Ilike to play and I think It's good to have more than one hobby that get's your mind off the computer
